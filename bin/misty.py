The main misty/manage executable
Misty is a command line interface to the manage libraries to manage the HPC clusters present in the Ghent University.
It ties in with quattor to detect the clusters and it's masters and nodes.
Manage also allows you to start and stop the pbs scheduler, put nodes online/offline,
reboot them (using ssh, impi, dmtf smash,...),
acknowledge services/hots in icinga/nagios...
Misty will parse the output manage output and show it in a somehow readable form to the user on the command line.
